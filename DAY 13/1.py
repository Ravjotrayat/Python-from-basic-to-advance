Time Complexity:The time complexity of an algorithm qualifies the amount
                of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the
                length of the input and not the actual execution time of
                the machine on which the algorithm is running on.

Asymptotic notation:It is a way to describe the running time or space
                    comlexity by using the Big-O notation,which determines
                    the set of functions grows slower than or at the same
                    rate as the expression.Furthermore it explains the
                    maximum time an algorithm requires to consider all
                    input values.
