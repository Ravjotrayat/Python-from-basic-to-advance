'''
Write a python program that accepts a text and displays a 
string which contains the word with the largest frequency
 in the text and the 
frequency itself separated by a space.
Rules:
The word should have the largest frequency.
In case multiple words have the same frequency, then choose 
the word that has the maximum length.
Assumptions:
The text has no special characters other than space.
The text would begin with a word and there will be only a 
single space between the words.
Perform case insensitive string comparisons whereverÂ 
necessary.
