#Question 3
'''
Write a higher order function, sum_all() to calculate the sum of
elements in a list.
sum_all() â€“ It accepts a list and calculates the sum of the elements in
the list based on the conditions being checked in the lambda expressions
passed to it.
Only those values satisfying the condition should be included
in the sum.
Write the following lambda expressions.
1. greater: To check whether a given number is greater than 10.
2. divide: To check whether a given number is divisible by 10 and
not greater than 100.
3. range_of_values: To check whether a given number is between 25 and 50
(Both inclusive).
